[LEARN REACT - Installation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.

```bash
	npx create-react-app my-app
	cd my-app
	npm start
```
